**This project is about designing a simple cache controller using VHDL and implementing it on a Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGA. The cache sits between the CPU and the main memory (SDRAM) and helps speed up memory access by storing recently used data in a small, fast local memory (BlockRAM). The cache is 256 bytes total, organized into 8 blocks, with 32 bytes per block. When the CPU sends a read or write request, the cache controller checks whether the requested data is already in the cache (cache hit) or not (cache miss). If it’s a hit, the data is read from or written to the cache directly. If it’s a miss, the controller may need to fetch a block from main memory or write an old block back to main memory first, depending on whether the block was modified (dirty bit). The controller uses tag, index, offset, valid, and dirty bits to manage this process. The goal is to correctly implement this logic, connect it to the CPU, SDRAM controller, and BlockRAM, and then measure performance metrics such as hit time, miss penalty, and block replacement time through hardware testing.**
